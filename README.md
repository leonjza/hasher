# Hasher™

Hasher™ is a completely client side password generator.
A master password and identifier is concatenated and then has a SHA3 hashing function applied to it to generate the output. Nothing is sent to any server, and you can download and run a local copy of this too.

Makes use of sha3.js from the CrytoJS repo @https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/

## Install
Simply clone the repository to a directory that a web server can serve, or clone to your computer and open `index.html` in your browser.
